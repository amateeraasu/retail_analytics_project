👨‍💻 **About Me**

Hi there! I'm Ajara, a Business Data Analytics Enthusiast, who likes transforming complex business questions into actionable insights through data-driven solutions. 

My data journey began when I was a volunteer at a local data lab agency in Kyrgyzstan back in 2020. This experience sparked my passion in data and led me to pursue my Master's Degree in Business Analytics and then a tech career in the US. 

I've since developed expertise in SQL, Python, Power BI, leading initiatives in sales performance tracking, inventory optimization, and end-to-end process automation.

This project showcases my ability to bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation.
