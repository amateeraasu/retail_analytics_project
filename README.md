**Project Overview: Automated Retail Analytics Platform**

**Business Problem Statement**

My boss currently manages multiple retail stores with manual data processing, leading to:

- Time-consuming manual calculations and reporting
- Delayed decision-making due to lack of real-time insights
- Potential human errors in data processing
- Inability to identify trends and patterns across stores
- Limited visibility into store performance comparisons

**Project Phases & Technical Implementation**

_Phase 1: Data Foundation (Snowflake + Python)_

- Data Migration: Extract data from multiple store systems via APIs
- Data Warehousing: Design and implement star schema in Snowflake
- Data Pipeline: Create automated Python scripts for data ingestion and transformation
- Data Quality: Implement validation rules and cleansing procedures

_Phase 2: Data Analysis & Exploration (SQL + Python)_

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Uncover patterns in sales, inventory, and customer behavior
- Business Metrics: Calculate KPIs like revenue per store, inventory turnover, seasonal trends
- Advanced Analytics: Cohort analysis, RFM segmentation, forecasting models
- Performance Benchmarking: Store-to-store comparisons and ranking systems

_Phase 3: Visualization & Reporting (Power BI)_

- Executive Dashboard: High-level KPIs and trends for leadership
- Operational Dashboards: Daily/weekly performance metrics for store managers
- Automated Reports: Scheduled delivery of key insights
- Interactive Analytics: Self-service exploration capabilities

**Key Stakeholder Benefits**

- Time Savings: Reduce manual reporting from days to minutes
- Real-time Visibility: Monitor all stores from a single dashboard
- Data-Driven Decisions: Make informed decisions based on actual trends
- Cost Optimization: Identify underperforming stores and optimization opportunities
- Revenue Growth: Spot high-performing products and successful strategies to replicate

For Store Managers:

- Performance Tracking: Clear visibility into their store's metrics
- Inventory Management: Automated alerts for low stock or overstock situations
- Customer Insights: Understanding of customer behavior and preferences
- Competitive Analysis: Benchmarking against other stores in the network
